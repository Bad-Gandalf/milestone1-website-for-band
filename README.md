# Milestone Project 1 - CREATE A WEBSITE FOR A BAND
#### by Patrick Doherty

I was required to build a static (front-end only) website for a band. I have been given the following requirements after interviews
with the client's representatives:

- Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
- Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.

I have also been given multimedia such as pictures, a video clip and audio clips which I have integrated into the site.
To add to this I have also added social media links in the footer of all pages. 

## UX
This website is for fans of The Monkees who may possibly wish to hire them for functions.

### Home
Quick, punchy introduction to  the Monkees if the user does not already 
know. Tips laid out for navigating the site quickly. A video of a Monkees 
performance to engage the user as quickly as possible, to see if they like the 
goods or are quickly reminded of their love for the Monkees.

### Gallery
Users can quickly find portraits of all band members with some information on 
each of them. Users can also see group pictures and album covers. 

### Listen 
Fans or prospective customers can listen to a few famous Monkees songs to help 
either identify the band by its music or simply increase the nostalgia in order
to close the deal.

### Contact
user can send message to
